                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Montreux at the lake of Genf</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A car, a tent and a surfboard. That and a whole lot of clothes was all we
                            needed when my girlfriend and I were leaving for what would turn out to be one of the best
                            experiences of our lives. In the middle of August 2019 we left Austria with the final
                            destination Seville, where we would do 6 months of Erasmus. Our first stop was Montreux, a
                            beautiful town at the lake of Genf. We found a wonderful camping site directly at the lake,
                            which was relatively cheap, considering swiss standards. There, we enjoyed the clear water
                            and the beautiful view over the Alps until it started raining heavily a day later. Because
                            of all the rain, we decided to head to the western coast of France as fast as we can.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/MontreuxCamping.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of Eduard Frankford sitting in front of the lake in Montreux" width="600" /></figure>

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Perigeux the city of wine</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">6 hours by car later we were in sunny Perigeux, a small medieval town with
                            delicious wine. We rented an AirBnb there because our tent was still soaking wet. In a
                            desperate intent to make it dry again, we put it over our car and probably looked like
                            homeless people at that point. Luckily the next day the tent was dry again (and our car
                            extremely dirty :-D).

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/Perigeux.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of Perigeux" /></figure>

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Mimizan</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After that we headed west to Mimizan, a place on the western coast of
                            France, known for good waves and what we didn’t know: kind of a weird smell. On the first
                            day we were wondering why the camping space or one of us was smelling. We joked about our
                            neighbors or about how we should shower more often, until we talked to some locals who told
                            us that a trash factory was nearby and when the wind was offshore in the morning, the smell
                            of trash spreads through the whole town. A thing to consider when one comes to Mimizan.
                            Besides the funny smell, we spent some nice days at the camping space, studying Spanish and
                            paddling into our first waves.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/Mimizan.jpg"

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Zarautz</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our next stop was Zarautz, a beautiful spot with one of the greatest
                            sunsets. Since the camping space was full when we arrived, we had to improvise and put our
                            tent into a field next to many other tents. Luckily a German guy was so kind to let us
                            connect to his electricity so we had cool beer again. We enjoyed the great view over the
                            town and went the 1000 steps down to the beach and then up again (great views come with a
                            price).

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/ZarautzView.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of the view from Grand Camping in Zarautz" /></figure>

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Galicia</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After Zarautz, we made our way through many small and beautiful places in
                            northern Spain, even joined a surf-camp for a week in Galicia. The surf-camp was newly
                            founded by two nice Germans and was for intermediate surfers, which was hard at first,
                            because there were some pretty high waves to surf, but I loved it. Galicia was cheap and a
                            car is a must have there, since there are not so many buses. From the surf-camp in Valdovino
                            we drove a few times to Pantin, a very famous beach where the Pantin calssics (a surf
                            tournament) was being held at the time.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/PantinClassics.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of the crowd and waves at Pantin Classics in Galicia" /></figure>

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Peniche</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before we got to Seville, we made one last stop in Peniche, Portugal.
                            Peniche is a nice fishing village with many surf-spots, especially famous for the super
                            tubos beach, which offers big barrels to surf when the conditions are right.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/SuperTubos.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of a Surfer surfing a barrel " /></figure>

                        </p>


                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Sevilla:</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Although we had some great days in Peniche, we grew more nervous the closer
                            we got to Seville, since we didn’t have any accommodation or confirmed courses for
                            university in advance. So when we reached Seville on September 9th, we were relieved to find
                            a accommodation in an Erasmus house on Facebook on the same day, which is where we spent the
                            semester with 13 other Erasmus students.
                        </p>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After we got accommodated, we went to organize our courses for university.
                            Well, ORGANIZE is maybe exaggerated, since everything in Seville was exactly the opposite of
                            organized. Buses never came when they should, shops were closed when you needed them and
                            secretarys in the university ALWAYS empty. It was a struggle for sure to get all the courses
                            we needed. But in the end everything worked out pretty good, considering our Spanish was not
                            not the best at the beginning. What nobody told us, is that the “Sevillianos” have a very
                            strong accent as well, so as you can imagine, the first weeks we had the one or other
                            difficulty communicating. But, because all of our courses in were in Spanish, we improved a
                            lot and can now claim to speak Spanish pretty fluently.
                            IMAGE OF THE UNIVERSIDAD THE SEVILLA

                            Especially at the beginning of the semester we joined many events of ESN (Erasmus network
                            Seville). They organized a welcome month that was really great. City tours, tapas evenings,
                            pub crawls, Sangriadas, beach trips, picnics, sports, weekend trips and much more.
                            IMAGE OF THE WELCOME MONTH PROGRAM
                            We had a lot of fun and met many people from all over the world. After a short time, we
                            found ourselves in a great group with around 10 people, with whom we spent most of our free
                            time in Seville. I couldn’t even count how many tapas I ate, Tintos de Verano (red wine with
                            Fanta lemon – delicious) I drank and went out to party at clubs. On the weekends we did a
                            lot of trips. I have been to Cordoba, Valencia, Granada, the “pueblos blancos”, the Algarve,
                            Cadíz, El Palmar (where you can surf in winter) and at the Caminito del rey.
                            So the months went by very fast. University went well for me, I had a great time with my
                            friends, visited beautiful places and felt very connected to Seville and the Spanish
                            culture. When I had to leave Seville at the end of January, I was a little sad in fact.
                            Those 6 months were awesome and I would do it all over again. But at the same time, I
                            appreciated coming home to Austria and being back in the mountains again.
