                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A car, a tent and a surfboard. That and a whole lot of clothes was all we
                            needed when my girlfriend and I were leaving for what would turn out to be one of the best
                            experiences of our lives. In the middle of August 2019 we left Austria with the final
                            destination Seville, where we would do 6 months of Erasmus.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Montreux at the lake of Genf</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            Our first stop was Montreux, a
                            beautiful town at the lake of Genf. We found a wonderful camping site directly at the lake,
                            which was relatively cheap, considering Swiss standards. The camping site is we stayed at can be found <a href="">here</a>
                            <br>
                            In montreux, we enjoyed the clear water of the lake geneve and the beautiful view over the Alps. Until, it started raining heavily a day later, because
                            of all the rain we decided to continue our journey and head to the western coast of France as fast as we can.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/MontreuxCamping.jpg"

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Perigeux the city of wine</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">6 hours by car later we were in sunny Perigeux, a small medieval town with
                            delicious wine. We rented an AirBnb there because our tent was still soaking wet. In a
                            desperate intent to make it dry again, we put it over our car and probably looked like
                            homeless people at that point. Luckily, the next day the tent was dry again (and our car
                            extremely dirty :-D).

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/Perigeux.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of Perigeux" /></figure>

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Mimizan</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After that we headed west to Mimizan, a place on the western coast of
                            France, known for good waves and what we didn't know: kind of a weird smell. On the first
                            day we were wondering whether the camping space or one of us was smelling. We joked about our
                            neighbors or about how we should shower more often. Some days later, we talked to some locals who told
                            us that a trash factory was nearby and when the wind was offshore in the morning, the smell
                            of trash spreads through the whole town. A thing to consider when one comes to Mimizan.
                            Besides the funny smell, we spent some nice days at the camping space, studying Spanish and
                            paddling into our first waves.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/Mimizan.jpg"

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Zarautz</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Our next stop was Zarautz, a beautiful spot with one of the greatest
                            sunsets. Since the camping space was full when we arrived, we had to improvise and put our
                            tent into a field next to many other tents. Luckily a German guy was so kind to let us
                            connect to his electricity so we had cool beer again. The camping was called TODO and the website can 
                            be found <a href="">here</a>. The camping in  Zarautz has one of the best views we have had during our trip. However to get to the
                            town you need to take approximately 1000 steps down, but all in all it is definitely worth it.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/ZarautzView.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of the view from Grand Camping in Zarautz" /></figure>

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Galicia</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After Zarautz, we made our way through many small and beautiful places in
                            northern Spain, even joined a surf-camp for a week in Galicia. The surf-camp was newly
                            founded by two nice Germans and was for intermediate surfers. The surf-camp is called Laybak Surfcamp and can be found <a href="">here</a>.
                            Sophia struggeled a bit ,because there were some pretty high waves to surf, but I loved it. Galicia was cheap and a
                            car is a must have there, since there are not so many buses. From the surf-camp in Valdovino
                            we drove a few times to Pantin, a very famous beach where the Pantin calssics (a surf
                            tournament) were being held at the time.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/PantinClassics.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of the crowd and waves at Pantin Classics in Galicia" /></figure>

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Peniche</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Before we got to Seville, we made one last stop in Peniche, Portugal.
                            Peniche is a nice fishing village with many surf-spots, especially famous for the super
                            tubos beach, which offers big barrels to surf when the conditions are right.

                        <figure class="mb-4"><img class="img-fluid rounded" src="../img/roadtrip/SuperTubos.jpg"
                                alt="Picture of a Surfer surfing a barrel " /></figure>

                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Sevilla:</h2>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Although, we had some great days in Peniche, we grew more nervous the closer
                            we got to Seville, because in once we arrived the road trip would be over and the 
                            next adventure would start, Erasmus in Sevilla (Read <a href="erasmussevilla.html">here</a>).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In Sevilla we had a lot of fun and met many people from all over the world. After a short time, we
                            found ourselves in a great group with around 10 people, with whom we spent most of our free
                            time in Seville. I couldn't even count how many tapas I ate, Tintos de Verano (red wine with
                            Fanta lemon -> delicious) I drank and went out to party at clubs. From Sevilla you can do many trips. 
                            I have been to Cordoba, Valencia, Granada, the “pueblos blancos”, the Algarve,
                            Cadíz, El Palmar (where you can surf in winter) and did the Caminito del rey.
                            All in all, I had a great time with my
                            friends, visited beautiful places and felt very connected to Seville and the Spanish
                            culture. 
                            I hope you good some valuable information out of this article and that you will enjoy the places recommended as much as I did!
                        </p>
