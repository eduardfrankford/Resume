                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            The <a href="http://www.booking.com/Share-7vjd43">Ocean View hotel</a> in Bentota is the
                            perfect place to start your Sri Lanka experience, because it is not far away from Columbo.
                            It can be reached by train for less than 1 Euro or if you want to travel comfortably, you
                            can take a taxi for around 40 Euros.
                            The manager there was the most courteous guy we met during the whole trip. He gave us many
                            valuable tips and showed us many cool things.
                            Generally, Bentota is a rather calm place in Sri lanka and it has a nice river with
                            mangroves, where you can do boat trips. During a boat trip we saw many warans, monkeys and
                            crocodiles.
                            Furthermore, in Bentota you can visit a turtle hatchery, where you can learn about why
                            turtles are endangered in Sri Lanka and you can even see an albino turtle.

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">2. Go surf in Weligama area</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            Weligama is the Surf-mekka in Sri Lanka. You can see tuk-tuks with surfboards on the roof
                            everywhere.
                            However, as the town is so famous for its nice beginner waves I would recommend to you to go
                            surf at Coconut Beach which is 10 minutes by
                            tuck tuck in the direction to Midigama and should cost no more than 3 Euros if you start in
                            Weligama to get there.
                            Coconut Beach is a nice reef break. There you can find two beach bars which sell Lion Beer
                            and Coconuts. Furthermore you can rent surfboards there
                            for a cheap price. I paid 1.5 Euros per hour.

                            Also if you want to go to a beach party ask the locals if they are planning something for
                            the days you are there.
                            Normally, they organize at least one party a week.

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">3. Book a whale watching tour in Mirissa</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            Mirissa is the whale watching capital of Sri Lanka. There you can easily find somebody by
                            whom you can book a day trip by boat to go search for these
                            beautiful animals.
                            However, be careful about the price, because the prices can range from 25 Euros to 50 Euros
                            per person. So don't forget to negotiate.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">4. Visit SK Town near Dondra Beach</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            The place called "Dondra bay", was the best place of our whole journey.
                            There we booked athe beautiful hotel called <a
                                href="https://www.theseascapesrilanka.com/">The Seascape</a>, which is located directly
                            at the beach. Another big advantage is that you can directly see the
                            line up when you open your curtains in the morning. If you need a surf lesson I can warmly
                            recommend to you <a href="https://surf-sktown.com/">Surf Sk-town</a> which is a surf school
                            owned by a local whose mom
                            has a beach restaurant where you can eat the best curry and the cheapest and best prawns I
                            have eaten in Sri Lanka.

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">5. Visit Yala National Park in the southeast of Sri Lanka</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            Yala national park is located in the southeast of Sri Lanka. As all the safaris start very
                            early in the morning I recommend to you to
                            stay at least 2 nights there. My girlfriend and I stayed at a calm place called <a
                                href="https://www.tarawatergate.com/"> Tara Watergate</a> which is located directly at a
                            lake.

                            On the safari we saw elephants, crocodiles, leppards, monkeys, many birds, warans and
                            countless other animals. I was really impressed with the variety that nature holds in this
                            small country.
                            We stayed in the park the whole day and when we got home 12 hours after we left, we were
                            pretty tired and overloaded with impressions. A very memorable day I have to say.
                            The next day we went back to Dondra bay, because we loved it there so much that we booked 3
                            more nights in the very same hotel that we have been to before. And once again we were not
                            disappointed and enjoyed every minute there.
