                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Travel preparations:</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">To be honest, I didn't prepare much for my Erasmus until about a month
                            before my departure.
                            But when panic spread 2 weeks before departure, I copied all my personal documents which was
                            good because in the Centro international you need a copy of your passport and ecard and
                            passport photos!). In addition, I brought a copy of my health insurance
                            and informed my bank about my stay. Furthermore, I received an insurance confirmation from
                            the ÖH. (which would not have been necessary).

                            In advance it is very helpful to join the Facebook groups (eg ESN Sevilla, Erasmus-Sevilla
                            ..) and the most helpful are
                            the Whatsapp groups. There you can often get information about apartments,
                            university courses and of course news about all the organized Erasmus events. There is also
                            a buddy program
                            one can join.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Departure and arrival at the place of study</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In the middle of August I drove towards Seville. After a road trip across
                            France,
                            Northern Spain (beautiful!) And Portugal I arrived in Seville on September 9th. Already a
                            couple of
                            days before, I searched through hundreds of apartment advertisements and sent messages.
                            Unfortunately
                            you rarely get an answer back. All in all finding an apartment was more difficult than
                            expected. However, I found an advertisement of an Erasmus house on Facebook which is where I
                            spent the semester with 13 other Erasmus students. In retrospect, however, I would
                            try to find an apartment before arriving in Seville and look at it via Skype
                            , as it saves you a lot of nerves. Also, you shouldn't have too big of
                            expectations when looking for an apartment, as the standards in Seville are different
                            than
                            in Austria.</p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">First steps</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">After I had an apartment, I went to the Centro Internacional (Av. De la
                            Ciudad Jardín,
                            20). In advance you should organize an appointment online (under cita previa on the website
                            from the US). At the Centro internacional you have to hand in a copy of your passport, ecard
                            copy and passport photo.
                            Have the confirmation of arrival signed and then you must go to the
                            next Santander Bank (at Gran Plaza) to deposit a few euros there. Then you have to go back
                            to the
                            Centro Internacional. You can also register for language courses there, preferably right
                            away.
                            Next you have to go to the faculty with the notes from the Centro internacional
                            Macarena (again with cita previa!). In Macarena, Pablo was responsible for us - a very nice
                            and
                            patient man with understandable spanish. He registers you for the individual subjects and
                            signs the learning agreement (don't forget!) He could always be reached via email..</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Erasmus Network</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Especially at the beginning of the semester, the various Erasmus
                            organizations organize many events. This way you get to know new people very quickly and you
                            can already see a lot
                            of the City. I was mostly traveling with the ESN Sevilla organization. They organized in
                            September a welcome month that was really great. City tours, tapas evenings, pub crawls,
                            Sangriadas, beach trips, picnics, sports, weekend trips and much more.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Spanish</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">One should know that Sevillian Spanish is very difficult to understand at
                            first. Although
                            I attended a B1 Spanish course beforehand, it was a challenge at first to communicate with
                            my
                            landlords, teachers and other locals. But you get used to it after some time.
                            Do not worry! </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Movement</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">A lot of people use the “Sevici” bike rental system (like the TT bikes in
                            Innsbruck). So
                            I also had an account and was mostly satisfied with it. It can happen that the
                            stations are empty when you need a bike or sometime they are full when you want to return
                            the bike.
                            If you plan enough time, you can simply drive to the next station.
                            However, especially from 10 am they are a bit full, so you should find out beforehand in the
                            "Sevici" app how
                            many bicycle spaces are free. Friends of mine bought their own bike, and from one of them
                            the bike got stolen. The buses are almost always unpunctual and take forever due to the many
                            traffic lights. There is only one metro line that goes from west to east, I used this one
                            also very often. </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">University Life</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In general,the university there is
                            very good. A little bit schoolish, with small "classes". In Computer Science if you do all
                            the homeworks during
                            semester you will pass without having to do the final exams. If you want to chill during the
                            semester you can also
                            do nothing and just study for the final exams (risky ;-)).
                            All in all I would say the intensity is similar to Innsbruck.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Tipps for outgoing students</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">Be sure to take warm sweaters and jackets with you !! Even if it has in
                            December and January
                            15-20 degrees during the day, it gets very cold in the evening and in the morning. Because
                            the houses are badly isolated.
                            A warm blanket is also necessary at night.
                            In my opinion, the most beautiful destinations nearby are: </p>
                        <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            <li>Granada</li>
                            <li>The Algarve</li>
                            <li>Caminito del rey</li>
                            <li>Pueblos blancos (especially Ronda and Zahara</li>
                            <li>There are also great "Sierras", especially the Sierra Nevada - in case you ever want to
                                visit the Alps
                                missing.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> Of course, Seville itself is beautiful too! Enjoy the time there, the weather and the tapas
                        </p>

                                    If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be
                                    private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and
                                    it has unquantified risks. -->
