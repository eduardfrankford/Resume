                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Travel preparations:</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            I went to Norway during the corona pandemic, so the most important thing to get for me was
                            the COVID test. Furthermore, the Norwegian Business School
                            organizes its Erasmus students appartements in advance, so I accepted the housing offer of
                            Anker Studentbolig and paid the first month of rent plus the deposit.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Departure and arrival at the place of study</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            I flew to Oslo from Vienna. Once arrived at the Oslo Airport it is really easy to get from
                            the Airport to the city center by train. Once you are there
                            just ask a local / employee and they will show you the stairs to the railway station. It is
                            possible to buy the tickets at a machine or online with the Ruter Billet app.
                            After having arrived at the central station I had to go to the quarantine hotel which was
                            also paid by the BI. After the quarantine I moved in to my appartement.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Anker Studentbolig</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            I lived at the Anker Studentbolig because I got an offer from them through the business
                            school. I have to say that my stay there was not good but also not bad. <br>
                            The advantages are:
                        <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            <li>
                                It is very central
                            </li>
                            <li>It is relatively cheap

                            </li>
                            <li>You are surrounded by other erasmus students</li>
                            <li>If you are at a high floor you have a good view</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> The disadvantages are: </p>
                        <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            <li>
                                Nearly every party got stopped at 11 pm because of somebody calling the security
                            </li>
                            <li>They charge for every small extra service (once I locked myself out and called the
                                security to open the door -> 50 Euros)</li>
                            <li>It can be a little noisy</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Erasmus Network</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            When I was there the Erasmus Student Organisations organized nearly no events. Maybe because
                            it was Covid time or maybe because they don't exist.
                            But I created a whatsapp group and posted the link in an Erasmus Facebook group. Over this
                            link nearly 150 people joined the group and then wrote a message to
                            ask if people want to go hiking, skiing, drinking etc.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Language</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In Norway nearly everybody speaks English perfectly. Therefor, it is not
                            neccessary to learn Norwegian, but if you are very motivated it is a nice plus if you can
                            speak it and then it might be easier to
                            join Norwegian parties. :-)
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Movement</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> I bought the Ruter monthly ticket for around 400 NOK per month. You can
                            also additionally buy the city bicicle subscription because it is very cheap.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">BI Campus</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            The BI Campus is one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen. It is very modern and
                            open and also has a very good and cheap cafeteria.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Tipps for outgoing students</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            Don't forget your warm clothes and if you are motivated to do outdoor sports take you ski
                            equipment with you because especially touring skis are very expensive
                            to rent. Cross country skis on the other hand are cheap to rent no need to take them with
                            you. I rented them at BOA for around 70 euros for the whole season.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Things I would recommend to do</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                        <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            <li>Rent cabins together with friends</li>
                            <li>Go surfing in Stavanger or the Lofoten</li>
                            <li>Go to Tromsoe and see the Northern Lights</li>
                            <li>Go ski touring or hiking in the Lofoten</li>
                            <li>Go cross country skiing in Oslo</li>
                            <li>Go ice bathing at Akker Brygge</li>
                            <li>Go to Sognsvann with friends and make a bonfire</li>
                        </ul>
                        Enjoy your stay!
