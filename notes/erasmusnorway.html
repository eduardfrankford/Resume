                            In January 2021 I went to Oslo to study at the Norwegian Business School BI. Therefore, I
                            thought this article might help anyone who is thinking about doing the same.
                            Spoler alert: It was an amazing experience and I can definitely recommend you to do it as
                            well.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Travel preparations:</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            I went to Norway during the corona pandemic, so the most important thing to get for me was
                            the COVID test. Furthermore, the Norwegian Business School
                            organizes its Erasmus students appartements in advance, so I accepted the housing offer of
                            Anker Studentbolig and paid the first month of rent plus the deposit.
                            The list of different housing providers can be found <a
                                href="https://www.bi.edu/study-at-bi/housing/">here</a>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Furthermore, always important when you go on Erasmus is the "Learning Agreement", which is a
                            list of the courses you can register for in the
                            foreign university and then get credits for those in your home university.
                            For the Norwegian Business School they have a separate list of courses specially for
                            exchange students. The list can be found
                            <a href="https://www.bi.edu/programmes-and-individual-courses/exchange-programme/">here</a>.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As you probably already know Norway can be pretty cold. Therefore, don't forget warm
                            clothes. Especially, if you are going there in winter.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Another thing I wish I took with me for my exchange, is all my ski equipment, because ski
                            touring equipment is very expensive to rent (around 50 euros a day).
                            If I would have take my ski touring equipment, I could have used it as well to go skiing at
                            <a href="https://skimore.no/oslo/">Skimore</a>, which is the
                            ski resort close to Oslo.
                            <br>
                            If you like to go skating (Cross country skiing) then I would also recommend to you to take
                            your equipment with you, because it is very hard to find skating ski to rent.
                            However, if you like the classic style then you can leave your equipment at home and rent
                            something for the whole season very cheaply or buy something on <a
                                href="https://www.finn.no/">finn</a>, which is
                            the Norwegian market for used goods
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            For the surfers here I bought a Surfboard there as well and then went surfing during the
                            easter break in Stavanger and afterwards I sold it again on Finn with a little profit. :-P
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Departure and arrival at the place of study</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            I flew to Oslo from Vienna. Once arrived at the Oslo Airport it is really easy to get from
                            the Airport to the city center by train. Once you are at the airport just ask an airport employee and
                            they will show you the stairs to the railway station.
                            It is possible to buy the tickets at a ticket machine or online with the <a href="https://ruter.no/en/">Ruter</a> Billet app.
                            After having arrived at the central station I had to go to the quarantine hotel, which was
                            also paid by the Norwegian Business School BI. After the quarantine I moved in to my appartement.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Anker Studentbolig</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            I lived at the Anker Studentbolig because I got an offer from them through the business
                            school. I have to say that my stay there was not good but also not bad. <br>
                            The advantages are:
                        <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            <li>
                                It is very central
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It is relatively cheap
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You are surrounded by other erasmus students
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you are at a high floor you have a very good view
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> The disadvantages are: </p>
                        <ul class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            <li>
                                Nearly every party got stopped at 11 pm because of somebody calling the security
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                They charge for every small extra service (once I locked myself out and called the
                                security to open the door -> 50 Euros)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It can be a little noisy (So take your airpods with you ;-))
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Erasmus Network</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            When I was there the Erasmus Student Organisations organized nearly no events. Maybe because
                            it was Covid time or maybe because they don't exist.
                            But I created a whatsapp group and posted the link in an Erasmus group on Facebook. Over this
                            link nearly 150 people joined the group and then wrote a message to
                            ask if people want to go hiking, skiing, drinking etc.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Language</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">In Norway nearly everybody speaks English perfectly. Therefore, it is not
                            neccessary to learn Norwegian, unless you are very motivated do it. The Norwegian language is very similar to German, so depending on wherer you come 
                            from it might be easy or hard for you to learn it. 
                            All in all, it might be a plus to speak Norwegian, because it allows you to make Norwegian friends easily.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Movement</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> I bought the <a href="hhttps://ruter.no/en/buying-tickets/tickets-and-fares/30-day-tickets/">ruter</a> monthly ticket for around 400 NOK per month. You can
                            also additionally buy the city bycicle subscription because it is very cheap.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">BI Campus</h2>
                        <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                            The BI Campus is one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen. It is very modern and
                            open and also has a very good and cheap cafeteria.
                        </p>
